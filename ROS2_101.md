# ROS2 101

Robot do stuff with messages it receives from other stuff

## Workspace

Contains packages in `/src` and the result of the build

- Creating a workspace = creating a `workspace_name/src` directory which will contain packages.

- When using packages from a workspace, it needs to be sourced after being built
```shell
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

## Packages

Packages contain files depending on the package goal:
- Files to define nodes (usually in a directory w/ the same name as the package)
- Resources such as robot/world models (in `models/` or `worlds/`)
- Message/service/action definitions (usually in `msg/`, `srv/`, and `action/`) *only for CMake packages*
- Launch files (in `launch/`)
- Config files for nodes or launch scripts (in `config/`)
- Tests, etc.

But also setup files:
- `setup.py` in Python, `CMakeLists.txt` in C++
- `package.xml` that need to be updated as the package is furnished with new content.

### Creation

- In the `src/` directory of the workspace
```shell
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_cmake <package_name>
```
-`--build-type` can also be `ament_python` for Python packages

### Packages.xml

`package.xml` contains all the dependencies used in the package: modules used in the nodes, ROS dependencies or packages.

```
<exec_depend>my_module_or_package_or_dependenc</exec_depend>
```

### setup.py / CMakeLists.txt

Contains what needs to be built from the package:
- Directories to include in the build
- Dependencies to install
- Information about the package

#### setup.py

- When adding a directory in the package (`launch/` for example), need to add it to the `data_files` argument
- Example with a config, launch, and worlds
```py
# Everything installed in ./install
data_files=[
    # Default lines when package is created
    ...
    (
        os.path.join("share", package_name, "config"),
        glob(os.path.join("config", "*.[yaml]*")),
    ),
    (
        os.path.join("share", package_name, "launch"),
        glob(os.path.join("launch", "*launch.[pxy][yma]*")),
    ),
    (
        os.path.join("share", package_name, "worlds"),
        glob(os.path.join("worlds", "*.[sdf]*")),
    ),
],
```

Also the nodes with their alias that should be possible to run via CLI included in
```py
entry_points={
    "console_scripts": [
        "example_alias= package_name.node_file:main",
        ...
    ]
}
```

## Nodes

Nodes are scripts that make the robot interact with its environment via information (messages) conveyed in channels.

Information follows a specific format, depending on the message that is used in the channel. Many libraries with different message types (`geometric_msgs`, `sensor_msgs`, or custom ones)

Channels can take multiple forms
- Topics: information is continuously published by a `Publisher`, and any node can contain a `Subscriber` which takes this information. Topics have a name usually like `/topic_name/more_precision/even_more_precision`, but dont use a number as first character after a `/`
- Services: information is sent (request) by one `Service Client` following a specific format (service format defined in a `.srv` file) to one or multiple `Service Server` which then respond (response) depending on the service format. Services also have a name, like topics.
```py
# Request format
a_msg_type name_of_my_request
---
# Response format
another_msg_type name_of_my_response
```
- Actions: Like a service, but the `Action Server` can send feedback to the `Action Client` while the request is prepared. Usually for tasks that take some time. Actions also have a name, like the last 2.
```py
# Request
# same format as a message defined in the service
---
# Result
---
# Feedback
```

In practice in Python, a node is an object that inherits `rclpy.node.Node` class that is instanciated and "spinned"

## Custom messages

- Don't forget to include the libraries and modules used in the `CMakeLists.txt`
- Names must start with a majuscule apparently
```c
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)

rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
  "srv/TargetPos.srv"
  "srv/Velovity.srv"
    DEPENDENCIES 
    geometry_msgs /// Used in the custom srv
    rosidl_default_generators
 )
```

- Need to include the custom package in which the messages are defined when used outside of the package (seems obvious) EVERYWHERE
    - In the node file using the custom message
    - In the package.xml

## Use external packages

- Install (binary / source) the package in your workspace, and use documentation (good luck) to understand how to use it in your project.

# Specifics

## Publish a message

```py
class RelevantNameAboutTheNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("node_name")
        self.publisher_ = self.create_publisher(message_type, "topic_name", 10 (I dont know this))
        ...

    def function_to_publish(self):
        msg = Message_type()
        msg.attribute_name_of_the_message = whatever_value 
        self.publisher_.publish(msg)
        ...
    ...

def main():
    rclpy.init(args=args)
    node = RelevantNameAboutTheNode()
    rclpy.spin(node)

    # Destroy the node explicitly just in case
    node.destroy_node()
    rclpy.shutdown()
```

You can use a timer to publish at a given rate:
```py
def __init__(self):
    ...
    timer_period: float = some_value 
    # Every timer_period seconds, the callback function (self.function_called_every_x_sec here) is called
    self.timer = self.create_timer(timer_period, self.function_called_every_x_sec)
    ...

def function_called_every_x_sec(self):
    ...
```

## Subscribe to a topic

A node can also be subscribed to a topic to work with some information
```py
class RelevantNameAboutTheNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("node_name")
        # Value 10 as 4th arg, no idea what this is for
        self.subscription = self.create_subscription(
            message_type, "topic_name", self.listener_callback, 10
        )
        self.subscription
        ...

    def listener_callback(self, msg: message_type):
        # Do something everytime you read a value
        # Note this has an argument: the message you read
        ...
    ...
```
